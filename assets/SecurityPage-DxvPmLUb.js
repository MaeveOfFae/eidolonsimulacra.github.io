## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Please report security issues by email:

- **Email:** <support@kindleloom.com>

Include the following in your report:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if available)
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if known)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a timeline for remediation after initial triage.

## Security Best Practices

### API Keys

- Do **not** commit API keys or secrets to source control
- Prefer browser-local configuration for normal use, and use environment variables only for development or deployment workflows that actually consume them
- Rotate keys periodically

### Dependencies

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review Dependabot PRs promptly

### Input Handling

- Treat LLM outputs as untrusted input
- Validate and sanitize exported files before publishing
